# Robot

A small, simple exercise to show some of my node/javascript skills.

## Rules

We have a field, unlimited in size, and a remotely controlled robot. Robot can only operate in the range of the radio towers present on the field.

## Program's task

User provides number of towers on the field, location and range of each tower and also a start and end point of the route that robot is supposed to go through.
Program's task is to tell if, given the location of towers and their range, such trip is possible.

## Running it

Download, open the folder, run `npm install` and then `iojs ./robot.js`.
Tested using io.js 1.8.3

## Cool stuff

io.js, some ES6, some functional programming magic (currying), bluebird, lodash.

## Not so cool stuff

No tests, some errors are not handled properly, some naming issues.
